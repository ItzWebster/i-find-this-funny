Hiya, this is iakzs.

I have come here to follow up on a previous incident with a user by the display name of "webster", username of "itzwebster", and userID of "481068576363773972", who has been going against not only Discord's Terms of Service but also their Developer Terms of Service as well, using his Discord bot called Oliver.

In a gist of things, this user has been engaging in various misconducts, primarily involving unauthorized access and misuse of Discord bot functionalities.

I am sending this document on behalf of concerned users and developers in the community, considering the implications of Webster's actions.

Now that I've explained an introduction for some context, let's get right into the underlying issue.

Firstly, Webster has been found leaking the Discord bot token, which poses a significant security risk. He has openly claimed to have the current bot token, further compromising security for all users involved. (proof)[images/proof1.png]  (proof)[images/proof2.png]

Additionally, Webster has engaged in disruptive raiding activities, utilizing mass pings to disrupt servers. This behavior has been documented multiple times, indicating a pattern of misconduct.

Moreover, his bot has been flagged for suspicious activities, and he has attempted to shift the blame onto others. He claims to have blacklisted users for abusing the bot, but those users have stated they do not trust him, and their reviews do not support his claims. (proof)[images/proof6.png]

We have gathered screenshots and evidence of these actions, including instances where Webster attempted to gain unauthorized access to server functionalities, such as creating invite links without consent. This clearly violates Discord's Developer Policy, which requires developers to notify Discord and affected users of potential unauthorized access to API Data. (proof)[images/proof.png]

Webster has not notified Discord or the affected users of the potential unauthorized access, further proving that he is in direct violation of the Developer Policy. (proof)[images/proof5.png]  (proof)[images/proof6.png]

We have taken action by reporting these activities to Top.gg Support, and we got a response from them that they are currently looking into the matter.

We believe that such activity should be addressed immediately, as Webster's actions pose a significant risk to many servers and their valuable data.

If you do wish to give us a response, feel free; I'll be keeping an eager eye out for your response.

We will keep you updated if we find any more evidence of Webster or any of his other accounts.

Kind Regards,
